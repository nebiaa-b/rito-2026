      <summary>My Story</summary>
      <p>
        Year 12 student at Onslow College, Wellington.  
        I believe courage isn’t the absence of fear — it’s choosing to step up even when no one is watching.
        <br><br>

        <strong>What I’m Involved In:</strong><br>
        • Competitive badminton (Secondary School Nationals)<br>
        • Chess<br>
        • Debating<br>
		• Conservation volunteer in Christchurch(tree planting, environmental initiatives)<br>
        • 2026 Prefect for Pursuing Growth - Leadership program in Onslow College<br><br>

        <strong>Academic Interests:</strong><br>
        Strong Excellence record; interested in policy, analysis, and understanding how Parliament shapes real-world change.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Leadership Journey:</strong><br>
        I ran for Student Representative last year. I was new and quiet, but I wanted to challenge the idea that leadership belongs only to the loudest.  
        I came second — and it taught me that authenticity, kindness, and effort matter.
        <br><br>

        <strong>What I Bring:</strong><br>
        Leadership that is steady, supportive, and focused on lifting others, especially the quiet ones.  
        Leadership isn’t about standing out — it’s about standing up for people.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Additional Information:</strong><br>
        • Resident Visa Holder — eligible to work in New Zealand<br>
        • NZ Learner Driver Licence (active)

      <summary>My Written Response</summary>
      <p>
        Moving from Christchurch to Wellington meant starting again from scratch.  
        I’ve always been quiet, so I naturally notice others who feel the same.  
        Reaching out became my way of building connection.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Supporting My Friend:</strong><br>
        I connected with Sana, an international student who was unsure and quiet.  
        We studied together at our own pace, and her confidence grew — and so did mine.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Leadership in the Classroom:</strong><br>
        As I helped Sana, other students joined us. The teacher trusted me to support the group while he worked with others.  
        This wasn’t planned — leadership happened naturally.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Beyond the Classroom:</strong><br>
        In Debate and Environment Club, I often checked on quieter students and paired people up.  
        Inclusion became something I naturally practised.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Where It Led:</strong><br>
        I was appointed Prefect for Pursuing Growth — not for being loud, but for being consistent, supportive, and genuine.
        <br><br>

        <strong>What I Want to Bring to Rito:</strong><br>
        A leadership style rooted in noticing people, including them, and helping everyone feel like they belong.

      <summary>My Written Response</summary>
      <p>
        Many young people feel Parliament is distant, intimidating, and “not for them.”  
        They believe they need a perfect list of experiences to be taken seriously.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Why Experience Isn’t Everything:</strong><br>
        Some students move cities or countries. Some restart their schooling. Some carry family or financial responsibilities.  
        These students often have strong perspectives but fewer “official” leadership roles.
        <br><br>

        Friends like Sana and Tala are incredibly bright and thoughtful — the kind of people Parliament needs —  
        but they hesitate because they don’t look like traditional candidates.
        <br><br>

        <strong>What We Should Value:</strong><br>
        Experience matters, but so do perspective, potential, curiosity, and lived insight.
        <br><br>

        <strong>Why I Care:</strong><br>
        I’ve moved cities myself. I know what it feels like to start from zero.  
        I don’t have a long list of programmes — but I have commitment, curiosity, and a genuine interest in policy.
        <br><br>

        I want to be part of Rito not just to contribute, but to show that meaningful voices aren’t limited to perfect CVs.

  <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion – Thank You</h2>

  <p>
    Engaging with Parliament shouldn’t feel like it’s only for the most confident or experienced.  
    I’m applying because I’m ready to learn, contribute, and represent young people like me —  
    the quiet ones, the new ones, the ones still finding their place.
    <br><br>

    I hope to bring steady leadership, genuine curiosity, and a commitment to including others.  
    Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited about the chance to learn and contribute.
    <br><br>

    <em><b>Note:</b></em> The experiences I shared involving friends (such as Sana and Tala)  
    are included with their full knowledge and consent.
